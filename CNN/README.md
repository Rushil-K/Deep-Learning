# 🔢 Image Recognition 0 to 9

A **Streamlit-based Image Recognition App** that predicts handwritten digits (0-9) using a deep learning model trained on the **MNIST dataset**.  
This app allows users to **upload multiple scanned handwritten digit images** and provides accurate predictions along with probability distributions.

## 📌 Features  
✔️ Predicts digits (0-9) from scanned handwritten images  
✔️ Accepts multiple image uploads at once  
✔️ Preprocessing handles background detection & correction  
✔️ Displays probability scores for better understanding  
✔️ Interactive bar chart visualization of predictions  
✔️ Optimized for clarity and ease of use

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python 3**  
- **Streamlit** (for the UI)  
- **TensorFlow / Keras** (for the deep learning model)  
- **NumPy & PIL** (for image processing)  
- **gdown** (for downloading the model from Google Drive)

## 📂 Setup & Installation  

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:  

### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Rushil-K/Image-Recognition-0-to-9.git
cd Image-Recognition-0-to-9
```

---

## 📸 Usage Guide  
- ** Currently **only predicts black and white images** i.e. both the white text on black background and the black text on white background.

### 🖼️ Uploading Images  
- **Scan and upload** your handwritten or Images from the web digit images.  
- Ensure **high visibility** (clear writing, minimal noise).  
- Upload **JPG, PNG, or JPEG** format files.  

### 📊 Interpreting the Output  
- The app will **display the predicted digit**.  
- A **bar chart visualization** will show the probability scores.

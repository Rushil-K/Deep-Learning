# **RNN-Based Sentiment Analysis and Movie Review Scraper**

## **Overview**

This project is a state-of-the-art sentiment analysis solution built using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). It incorporates a custom-built web scraper that dynamically extracts movie reviews from Metacritic. The collected data undergoes a robust preprocessing pipeline before being used to train an RNN model that classifies reviews as either positive or negative. Additionally, the project includes a recommendation system that suggests movies based on sentiment trends. This solution is designed for scalability and can be extended to other domains requiring sentiment-based classification.

## **Key Features**

* **Dynamic Web Scraper**: Efficiently scrapes Metacritic movie reviews, handling pagination and saving structured data in CSV format.  
* **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes an RNN-based architecture to achieve high-accuracy sentiment classification.  
* **Text Preprocessing Pipeline**: Includes tokenization, text vectorization, and data cleaning to enhance model performance.  
* **Scalability**: Can be adapted to process large-scale datasets and extended for other NLP applications.  
* **Recommendation System**: Uses sentiment scores to provide meaningful movie recommendations.  
* **Fully Open-Source**: No reliance on paid APIs, ensuring accessibility and transparency.

## **Setup Instructions**

### **Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the project:
```
pip install selenium beautifulsoup4 pandas numpy tensorflow keras scikit-learn
```
### **Running the Scraper**

1. Open `kkrk2127_movies_scraper_Metacritic.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Run all cells to execute the scraper, which will fetch and save movie reviews to `metacritic_reviews.csv`.

### **Training and Using the Sentiment Analysis Model**

1. Load the `IMDB Dataset.csv` and `metacritic_reviews.csv` datasets.  
2. Preprocess the text data using the tokenizer (`tokenizer.pkl`).  
3. Train the RNN model and save it as `sentiment_analysis_model.h5`.  
4. Use the trained model to classify new reviews and analyze sentiment trends.

### **Extending the Project**

* **Enhance Model Performance**: Experiment with LSTM and GRU layers for improved accuracy.  
* **Deploy as a Web App**: Integrate with a frontend using Flask or Streamlit for real-time sentiment analysis.  
* **Expand Data Sources**: Extend the scraper to additional review platforms like IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes.

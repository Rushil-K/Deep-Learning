##  Overview  

This **interactive ANN dashboard** is built using **Streamlit** to train and evaluate an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** on a dataset with customizable hyperparameters. It provides **insightful visualizations** and performance metrics for better model understanding.  

---

##  Features  

- **Train an ANN Model** with user-defined hyperparameters  
- **Live Accuracy & Loss Graphs**  
- **Confusion Matrix for Performance Evaluation**  
- **Feature Importance using SHAP Values**  
- **Class Distribution & Data Analysis**  
- **Real-time Model Inference & Insights**  

---

##  Dataset  

- The dataset is dynamically loaded and processed.  
- The **target variable** is **"Converted"** (binary classification).  
- Features include **Age, Gender, Income, Purchases, Clicks, Spent**, etc.  

---

##  Dashboard UI  

-  **Sidebar** for **Hyperparameter Selection**  
-  **Train Model Button** to start training after selection  
-  **Performance Metrics** (Accuracy, Loss, Confusion Matrix)  
-  **Feature Importance Analysis**  

---

##  How It Works  

1️ **Select hyperparameters** (epochs, learning rate, activation function, etc.)  
2️ **Click "Train Model"** to start training  
3️ **View performance metrics**, confusion matrix, and feature importance

# 🔬 Deep Learning - ANN Dashboard  

### 🎯 Live Demo: [Visit Here](https://deep-learning-y9mzjiqycyib63ewyfwkgg.streamlit.app/)  

## 📌 Overview  

This **interactive ANN dashboard** is built using **Streamlit** to train and evaluate an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** on a dataset with customizable hyperparameters. It provides **insightful visualizations** and performance metrics for better model understanding.  

---

## 🚀 Features  

✔ **Train an ANN Model** with user-defined hyperparameters  
✔ **Live Accuracy & Loss Graphs**  
✔ **Confusion Matrix for Performance Evaluation**  
✔ **Feature Importance using SHAP Values**  
✔ **Class Distribution & Data Analysis**  
✔ **Real-time Model Inference & Insights**

## 📂 Dataset  

- The dataset is dynamically loaded and processed.  
- The **target variable** is **"Converted"** (binary classification).  
- Features include **Age, Gender, Income, Purchases, Clicks, Spent**, etc.  

---

## 🎨 Dashboard UI  

- 🔧 **Sidebar** for **Hyperparameter Selection**  
- 🎛️ **Train Model Button** to start training after selection  
- 📊 **Performance Metrics** (Accuracy, Loss, Confusion Matrix)  
- 🔍 **Feature Importance Analysis**  

---

## 🏗️ How It Works  

1️⃣ **Select hyperparameters** (epochs, learning rate, activation function, etc.)  
2️⃣ **Click "Train Model"** to start training  
3️⃣ **View performance metrics**, confusion matrix, and feature importance

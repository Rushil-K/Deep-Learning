        "## **Project Overview**\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of this project is to predict the conversion rate of customers based on a dataset of 1 million records. The primary objective is to build a predictive model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to determine whether a customer will convert (i.e., make a purchase or take a desired action) based on various customer features. The model was then deployed using **Streamlit**, allowing for real-time predictions and insights through an interactive dashboard.\n",
        "\n",
        "This report provides a comprehensive overview of the entire process, from data curation to preprocessing, model training, and deployment.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Dataset Description**\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset contains 1 million entries and 8 columns, with the following features:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **CustomerID**: A unique identifier for each customer.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Age**: The age of the customer.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Gender**: The gender of the customer (categorical, encoded as 0 for Male and 1 for Female).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Income**: The income of the customer.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Purchases**: The number of purchases made by the customer.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Clicks**: The number of clicks made by the customer on advertisements or products.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Spent**: The amount of money spent by the customer.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Converted**: The binary target variable indicating if the customer converted (1) or not (0).\n",
        "\n",
        "The target variable, **Converted**, represents the conversion rate, and the other features represent various customer demographics and interactions. The dataset exhibits some class imbalance, with a higher proportion of non-converted customers.\n",

        "## **Steps Taken**\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1\\. Data Curation**\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset, containing 1 million records, was curated to ensure data quality and completeness. This involved ensuring that there were no missing values and that the data was clean for model training. The dataset contained both categorical (e.g., **Gender**) and continuous (e.g., **Income**, **Purchases**) variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given the large size of the dataset, careful consideration was given to how the data could be processed efficiently for model training. Additionally, class imbalance in the **Converted** target variable was acknowledged and addressed during preprocessing.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2\\. Data Preprocessing**\n",
        "\n",
        "Data preprocessing is a critical step in preparing the dataset for machine learning, particularly when dealing with large datasets. The following preprocessing steps were performed:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Encoding Categorical Features**:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * The **Gender** feature, which is categorical, was encoded into numeric values using **OrdinalEncoder**. Gender was represented as 0 for Male and 1 for Female.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Handling Class Imbalance**:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Since the target variable **Converted** was imbalanced (more non-converted customers than converted), **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** was applied to oversample the minority class and balance the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Standardization**:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * To ensure that all continuous variables had similar ranges and to improve the efficiency of training, **StandardScaler** was used to standardize features such as **Age**, **Income**, **Purchases**, **Clicks**, and **Spent**.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Train-Test Split**:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * The data was split into a training set (80%) and a test set (20%) using **train\\_test\\_split** to ensure that the model could be tested on unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Class Weights**:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Class weights were computed using **compute\\_class\\_weight** to account for the class imbalance and ensure the model did not favor the majority class (non-converted customers).\n",

        "### **3\\. Model Training**\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the data was preprocessed, the model training began. The following steps were taken during the training process:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Model Architecture**:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * A **Sequential** ANN model was built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**. The architecture consisted of an input layer followed by several dense layers with **ReLU** activation functions, and dropout layers to prevent overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * The final output layer was a single neuron with a **sigmoid** activation function to classify the data into two classes: converted (1) and not converted (0).\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Hyperparameter Selection**:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Various hyperparameters, such as **epochs**, **learning rate**, **optimizer**, **activation function**, **dropout rate**, and **number of neurons per layer**, were selected through the Streamlit UI.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * The model used optimizers like **Adam**, **SGD**, and **RMSProp**, with the learning rate being set from options: `0.01`, `0.001`, or `0.0001`.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * A range of values for **dropout rates** (0.1 to 0.5) and **dense layers** (2 to 5 layers) were provided for experimentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Training**:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * The model was trained using the preprocessed training data, with a **batch size of 128** and **epochs** selected based on user input through the Streamlit interface. The model also incorporated **class weights** to address class imbalance.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Early stopping** was not used, but the model was trained for a specified number of epochs with **validation split** set to 0.2 to monitor performance during training.\n",

        "\n",
        "After training, the model was evaluated using the following metrics:\n",

        "* **Test Accuracy**: The accuracy of the model on the test dataset was calculated to evaluate how well the model generalized to unseen data.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "  * A confusion matrix was created to visualize how well the model predicted each class (converted or not converted). This provided insight into false positives and false negatives.\n",

        "* **Classification Report**:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * A detailed classification report was generated, showing **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score** for both the converted and non-converted classes.\n",
